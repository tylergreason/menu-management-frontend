# Menu Management Frontend Level 1

Hi, and thanks for reviewing my code! This was written to satisfy the requirements for a take home coding challenging, defined here: 

### Level 1: Basics

Present a Menu as a series of Menu Item Cards, having:

- Image (any random image)

- Title

- Description

- Price

- This should be responsive and readable on desktop or mobile browser

I kept things simple and to the point for this challenge. It took me longer than anticipated because I have not used React in quite a while, but I found that a lot of what I was missing came back to me as I progressed.
